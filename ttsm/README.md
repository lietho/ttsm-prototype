## Time-travelling State Machine Prototype for verifiable inter-organizational Business Processes
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7779531.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7779531)

A prototypical implementation of a time-travelling state machine for inter-organizational business process and workflow management. This prototype shows the viability of time-travel verification of business process and
workflow activities that are backed by the immutability and traceability of a blockchain.
Collaboration with other business partner works with a peer-to-peer approach using [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db).

This project is a fork of this [ttsm-prototype](https://github.com/danielkleebinder/ttsm-prototype) project by @danielkleebinder.

## Installing dependencies
The application solely relies on node packages. Therefore, you can use your preferred node package manager to install all required dependencies.
The prototype was tested on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.15.0 LTS.

```bash
> npm install
> yarn install
```

## Running the app

To run the app, [docker compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) has to be installed locally. Afterwards, you have to choose which consistency strategy to use before continuing. For
this, edit both environment files ``.env-stack-1`` and ``.env-stack-1`` in the ``/config`` directory and either use ``orbitdb-emv``, ``orbitdb`` or ``noop`` as your
``CONSISTENCY_STRATEGY``. Afterwards continue on with the applicable follow-up section:

### No-Operation (NoOp) Strategy

This strategy is the simplest of all. It does not dispatch any messages to any other participants, but instead, just feeds everything back with a short delay simulating the network. This strategy is
useful for developing. If you are working locally, you can also set this strategy in your ``environment.ts`` file directly. Now you can either start your application using

```bash
> npm run start
```

or by leveraging on your Docker environment by using the launch script ``launch.sh``

```bash
> launch.sh
```

### OrbitDB Strategy
The OrbitDB persistence and consistency strategies use the OrbitDB Event Log for storing all events and even exchanging events with other nodes (i.e., business partners running the ttsm-prototype).
The following environment variables can be configured in the ``.env-stack-X`` file:

```properties
PERSISTENCE_ORBITDB_ID=organization-a
PERSISTENCE_ORBITDB_IPFS_PORT=4102
PERSISTENCE_ORBITDB_IPFS_PORT_WS=4103
```

- The `PERSISTENCE_ORBITDB_ID` assigns an identifier to the OrbitDB instance.
- The `PERSISTENCE_ORBITDB_IPFS_PORT` and `PERSISTENCE_ORBITDB_IPFS_PORT_WS` configures the swarm ports which are used in the local [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) instance that gets started. 

After everything has been configured, you can start your stacks using the launch script ``launch.sh``

```bash
> launch.sh
```

### OrbitDB Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Strategy
The `orbitdb-evm` consistency strategy uses the OrbitDB strategy in the background and additionally posts hash-based commitments onto an Ethereum Smart Contract.
Therefore, [web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) must be configured with a WebSocket address to an Ethereum client, an account address and a private key for signing the transactions.
Additionally, the address of the `HashStorage.sol` smart contract can be set, it is already pre-filled with a deployed contract address on the Ethereum Goerli Testnet that can be used for demonstration purposes.

After everything has been configured, you can start your stacks using the launch script ``launch.sh``

```bash
> launch.sh
```

### Known Issues
- Due to OrbitDB still being in alpha-stage, it has issues running inside Docker containers. Even running the ttsm-prototype locally (outside Docker) does not work reliable all the time. Clearing the local IPFS and OrbitDB repository directories often helps.

## Stopping the app

If you started you application stacks using Docker, you can use the stop script ``stop.sh`` to stop all containers.

```bash
> stop.sh
```
